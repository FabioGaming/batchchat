# BatchChat
This is a very old project I once started to code for fun, I never finished it tho
It was supposed to be a Chatroom localted inside of a Network Drive, it does log chat and users and has the basic systems working, but chat interaction isn't really a thing
Do whatever you want, test it, finish my work, fix bugs.

# Usage
- Place BatchChat.bat and Chat.bat into the same Folder, otherwise they can't locate each other
- Run BatchChat.bat
- Do what you want inside of the Main menu
